## Session Summary
- The party gathered in **The Bilge** beneath the Brass Tide Inn, bickering playfully over the aftermath of the **Penance Sandwich** (dark rye, bitter mustard, salted beef, pickled roots)—Giotto’s basil-tinged pizzas seemed preferable.  
- A mysterious note urged them to retrieve a **stolen Ivory Ledger fragment** hidden in the Western Narrows’ tide tunnels before House Suntwill’s agents could destroy their leverage.  
- They tracked a cloaked figure into the archway, and **Elias** deftly slapped the water-stained page free. Giotto’s olfactory check confirmed its sea-soaked origins.  
- With the captive forced to guide them, Giotto Wild-Shaped into a **ferret** and located the first cache behind driftwood.  
- **Cypress’s Insight** (19) on the recovered pages revealed marginal coordinates pointing to a second cache beneath the tide-marker post; Whistler’s melody-humming and Elias’s Disarm (22) neutralized wards and traps.  
- They surfaced on the quay, confirmed the tide-marker map, and discovered a hidden lever mechanism to safely open the second pouch—Whistler’s “Mission Impossible” whistle adding dramatic flair.  
- **Giotto’s Investigation** in ferret form (9) initially missed the pages, but a subsequent search recovered them.  
- As they waited for the “third bell past noon,” the captive attempted to flee—**Cypress** (20 Athletics) pinned him, and Whistler’s ticking mimicry set the tense atmosphere.  
- Under combined Intimidation (Blessed Monkey Nat 20) and Persuasion (Cypress 18), the captive confessed Mallis’s deeper plot:  
  - **A second ward-trapped chest** under the steward’s office at the Umber Spire  
  - **Slough-Slicker operatives** primed to ambush them  
  - A coded knock (“three taps, then a hum”) to frame the party as thieves  
- **(Giotto noticed the captive wet himself in fear.)**

## Key New Lore & Hooks
- **House Suntwill’s Deception:** Mallis planted two caches (first in the tunnels; second under the steward’s office) and plans to frame the party via a secret knock code.  
- **Code Knock:** “Three taps, then a hum”—use the correct signal or be arrested.  
- **Slough-Slicker Threat:** Cult operatives lie in wait for an ambush at the Spire.  
- **Wardcraft Details:** Melody-keyed traps respond both to Orlen’s tune and to hidden levers; cutting wires prematurely triggers backlash.  
- **Penance Sandwich Tension:** A goofy but memorable moment that revealed character quirks and banter.  
- **Captured Informant:** Bound, frightened, and now aware of Mallis’s full scheme—may betray allies or lead to further clues.

*Session paused as the tide turns. Next: race to the Umber Spire, disarm the steward-office chest, and deliver the pages under the Argent Nettle lantern.*
